# Machine Olfaction in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics
### A Survey on the State of the Art, Opportunities, and Open Questions
---
This repository hosts the only survey of its kind that intersects machine olfaction with modern artificial intelligence and robotics. 
We hope this gives the community a state of the union on where the sense of smell for robotics currently stands and where the open questions lie.

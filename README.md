# Machine-Olfaction-in-AI-and-Robotics
This repository hosts the only survey of its kind that intersects machine olfaction with modern artificial intelligence and robotics. 
We hope this gives the community a state of the union on where the sense of smell for robotics currently stands and where the open questions lie.
